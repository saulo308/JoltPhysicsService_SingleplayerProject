# Build image base from zipped grpc and joltphysics files
# Alternatively, you could make a Dockerfile that "git clone's" the grpc and joltphysics folders
# However, there's no guarantee that it will work with newer versions
# Another alternative is just using a pre-built base image from a remote repository (if available)
docker build -t jolt-physics-service-base-jolt-only -f Dockerfile_imagebase . --progress=plain 

# Also, we could build with the tag ready to be pushed to a repository on dockerhub

==== Debug on ubuntu virtualbox: We need to disable hypervisor to run joltphysics and grpc on the virtualbox instance
1.Open a Command Prompt in Windows Host as Administrator.
2.Disable Hypervisor lunch
	bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
3. Disable Microsoft Hyper-V
	DISM /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V
4. Shutdown quick 
	shutdown -s -t 2
5. Wait a few seconds before turn it on.

==== Revert:
1. bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto
2. DISM /Online /Enable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V /All
3. shutdown -s -t 2
